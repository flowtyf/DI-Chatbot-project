# Video Game Recommendation Chatbot

Welcome to my personalized video game recommendation chatbot! Built as part of my studies at Developers Institute NZ, this bot is designed to offer game suggestions tailored to each user's unique preferences. 

## Features

    - Intuitive conversational flow.
    - Sensible reply logic.
    - Rock solid handling of edge cases.

## Dependencies

This project heavily relies on JavaScript for its core functionality.

## Installation and Setup

To run the chatbot on your local system, you'll need to:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Confirm JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.
3. Open index.html to start the application, preferably using live server in VSCode or equivalent tool.

As this project was a part of my early coursework I no longer intend to work on it, but feel free to give any feedback or submit a pull request!
