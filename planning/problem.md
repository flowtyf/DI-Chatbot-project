# Chatbot

## Problem statement

Create a video game recommendation chatbot that tailors suggestions based on user preference of adventure or action. For adventure, ask about preferred gameplay style (solo/multiplayer) and recommend MMO/RPG. For action, inquire about preference for fighting/FPS games and suggest accordingly. If the user is unsatisfied, provide a link to top games in the genre for further research.
At any point during the chat, the user can type 'reset' to reset the bot, or 'help' for a description of the bots functions.

Extra features WIP: the bot offers a random game recommendation twice, before the user is directed to a link of the top games in the genre.
